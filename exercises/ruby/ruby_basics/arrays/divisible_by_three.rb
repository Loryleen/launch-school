# Q : An array containing five numbers is assigned to numbers.
#   : Use Array#select to iterate over numbers and 
#   : return a new array that contains only numbers divisible by three.
#   : Assign the returned array to a variable named divisible_by_three.
#   : Print its value using #p.


numbers = [5, 9, 21, 26, 39]

divisible_by_three = numbers.select do |number|
  number % 3 == 0
end

p divisible_by_three
